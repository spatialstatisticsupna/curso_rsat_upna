## Introduction

The aim of this course is to learn how to handle **multispectral imagery** in R from major **publicly-available data archives**. These materials teach you the basic/intermediate concepts to retrieve, manage, and process satellite images locally in your computer in a simple and effective manner with `rsat`.

In this introductory section, we start by understanding the basic notions of multispectral images (Section \@ref(theory-images)) and data archives (Section \@ref(theory-archives)). We won't explain both aspects in detail but just enough to have some basic knowledge about what we are dealing with. Alongside explanations, we run embedded code examples so it is key that your software is up-to-date.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Software installation

Check that you are using the latest version of `R` and `RStudio`. Otherwise, click [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to install both (in that order). Once you are done, use the following commands to install `rsat` from our [Github repository](https://github.com/spatialstatisticsupna/rsat):

```{r eval=FALSE}
# load devtools library
library(devtools)

# Install rsat from the GitHub repositoy
install_github("spatialstatisticsupna/rsat")
```

Additional data and provisional procedures are available in another package called `rsatExtra`. To install it, simply run:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install rsatExtra from the GitHub repositoy
install_github("spatialstatisticsupna/rsatExtra")
```

#### Linux

If you are using Linux, you need to install some additional libraries before installing `R`. See the commands below to install all the applications for *Debian/Ubuntu* and *RedHat/Fedora*.

#### *Debian/Ubuntu*

        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install r-cran-rcpp gdal-bin libgdal-dev libproj-dev libssl libssl-dev xml2 libxml2-dev libmagick++-dev

#### RedHat/Fedora

        sudo dnf install gdal gdal_devel proj_devel xml2 libxml2_devel libcurl_devel openssl_devel ImageMagick-c++_devel

## Multispetral images {#theory-images}

We focus on ***optical multispectral images*** because it is perhaps one of the most popular data products. It has proven to be a very valuable source of information in many fields such as ecology, agronomy, hydrology, or economic sciences. Note that satellites can provide several other data products beyond multispectral images, e.g. aerosol or atmospheric gas concentrations, digital elevation models (DEMs), etc.

Multispectral satellite images are measurements of ***electromagnetic radiation*** captured by ***passive*** (*vs.* active) sensors aboard satellites. Passive sensors measure the radiation emitted by external sources like the sun (*vs.* emitting radiation themselves). The sun emits radiation which passes through the atmosphere an reaches the earth's surface, where it is absorbed or reflected. Reflected radiation travels again through the atmosphere to the sensing device. On its way through the atmosphere, light is absorbed or scattered due to interaction of radiation with atmospheric particles.

Sensors, atmosphere, topography, and the sun distort the radiation measurements. Data providers pre-process the images to compensate for these disturbances. There are several ***levels*** of processing depending on the corrections applied. For convenience, in this course we focus on the maximum level (Level 2). Level 2 images provide the ***surface reflectance*** - the reflected radiation relative to the incident radiation. It is a ratio so it has no units and value range between $0$ and $1$. Correction algorithms are constantly updated. When the updated algorithms is applied to pre-existing or new measurements organizations release a new ***collection or version*** of data.

Electromagnetic radiation can be described as a continuous ***spectrum*** of wavelengths. Our eyes perceive a small portion of the entire spectrum ($400-700nm$), which is referred to as visible spectrum. Sensors on board satellites capture slices of the spectrum, called ***bands***, in and beyond the visible range. We talk about ***multispectral*** images when the number of bands is in the order of 10s and ***hyperspectral*** when it is in the order of 100s. Objects and colors can be detected thanks to the distinctive amount of radiation (***intensity***) that they reflect in each band.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data archives {#theory-archives}

### Programs, missions, and satellites

Multispectral images are freely available thanks to satellite ***programs*** supported by public agencies. The three major satellite programs are [Landsat](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/) (NASA/USGS), [MODIS](https://www.copernicus.eu/es) (NASA), and [Copernicus](https://www.copernicus.eu/es) (ESA).

Programs can develop one or several ***missions*** and, for each mission, agencies launch one or multiple satellites to meat a particular goal (e.g., weather observation, land monitoring, sea-level surveillance). For instance, the Landsat program has carried out 8 missions so far (Landsat-1/8) and there is a 9th on the making (launch scheduled on spring 2021).

Missions are accomplished by ***satellites*** which carry specific sensors or instruments for the task. When several satellites are devoted to a single mission they are referred to as ***constellations***. For instance, the Terra and Aqua satellites from the constellation of the MODIS mission. A list of on-going governmental programs and their missions, satellites, and sensors can be found below.

### Web services

Information collected from satellites is saved in repositories which can be freely accessed using ***web services***. Web services work as an interface between the user and the data repositories, finding and retrieving the requested data-sets to the user. In order to obtain multispectral images from the three programs, sign-up in the following web services (for convenience, try to use the same *username* and *password* for all of them):

-   **EarthData** : [\<https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new\>](https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new){.uri}

-   **Scihub** : [\<https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/\#/self-registration\>](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/self-registration){.uri}

-   **EarthExplorer** (optional): [\<https://ers.cr.usgs.gov/register\>](https://ers.cr.usgs.gov/register){.uri}

#### Demo \#1: MODIS download using the GUI of EarthExplorer

Data can be requested through the Guided User Interface of each web service. We will conduct a small demonstration using EarthExplorer's GUI to find MODIS images covering Navarre from `03/05/2019` to `05/05/2019`. In the jargon of Geographic Information Systems, Navarre is our ***Region of Interest (ROI)*** and extensively the time period is our ***Time of Interest (TOI)***.

1.  Go [here](https://ers.cr.usgs.gov/login) and introduce your credentials. The website sends you to a new one with a panel on the left-hand side and a map on the right one.

2.  Search Navarre on the map. Pick the polygon tab on the left-hand side menu and draw a polygon around the region. Fill-in the starting and ending dates in the appropriate field on the left-hand side panel. Then hit the *Data Sets* button.

    ![](imgs/ee_modis_navarre.gif)

3.  Select the data product on the panel on your left. To find the *MOD09GA* product, you should expand the menu under *NASA LPDAAC Collections*. Then click on *MODIS Land Surface Reflectance V6* (we will understand more deeply the meaning of this in future sessions). Pick the *MOD09GA* product and click on *Results.* A pop-up message appears indicating the system is searching the available images.

    ![](imgs/ee_modis_navarre2.gif)

4.  The results are displayed on the left. You should see three results (one image for each day). If you click on the icon with a green arrow pointing downwards, you will download each of them separately. Repeat the process with every image in the list.

    ![](imgs/ee_modis_navarre3.gif)

Data portals are straightforward and intuitive. However, they can be tedious when requesting longer periods and more data products. Here is (one situation) where `rsat` becomes handy. The package sends requests from `R` to the web service programatically using *Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)*.

### Data products

#### Names

As mentioned earlier, these tutorial mostly concern ***optical multispectral images*** reporting about ***surface reflectance*** (Level 2). However, `rsat` gives access to products with other levels of pre-processing. Agencies and web services name their products using short-names or ***ID**s*. Some of them are listed below. We rely on `rsat`'s manual and tables like the one below to remember the *IDs* of each data product.

```{r data_table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(pander)
data <- "
  Program    | Mission    | Satellite | Sensor | ID             
  Landsat    | Landsat-7  | Landsat-7 | ETM    | Landsat_ETM_C1
  Landsat    | Landsat-8  | Landsat-8 | OLI    | Landsat_8_C1
  MODIS      | MODIS      | Terra     | MODIS  | MOD09GA
  MODIS      | MODIS      | Aqua      | MODIS  | MYD09GA
  Copernicus | Sentinel-2 | 2A        | MSI    | S2MSI2A
  Copernicus | Sentinel-2 | 2B        | MSI    | S2MSI2A
  Copernicus | Sentinel-3 | 3A        | OLCY   | SY_SYN__
  Copernicus | Sentinel-3 | 3B        | OLCY   | SY_SYN__
"
df <- read.delim(textConnection(data),header=FALSE,sep="|",strip.white=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
names(df) <- unname(as.list(df[1,]))
df <- df[-1,]
row.names(df)<-NULL
pander(df, style = 'rmarkdown', caption = "Operational missions collecting multi-spectral satellite images and their relevant details")
```

#### Product characteristics

Types of resolutions:

-   **Spatial resolution**: the area covered by a single pixel.

-   **Temporal resolution**: time-span between consecutive images.

-   **Spectral resolution**: number of bands.

-   **Radiometric resolution:** number of intensity levels that it is able to measure.

#### Tiling systems

Sensors scan the earth's surface in a continuous fashion but data records are deliberately broken into pieces so they can be processed and shared more easily. The divisions follow a pre-established grid system that is formed by cells or ***tiles***. We recommend you to know in advance which tiles cover your area of interest, even though the tile selection is made automatically by `sat_search()`.

\<\center\>

-   Tiling systems differ among programs:

    -   **Landsat:** Uses the [*World Reference System 2*](https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/worldwide-reference-system). Tiles are identified according to their path and row numbers which specify their location from East to West and North to South respectively. A shapefile of the WRS2 can be downloaded from [here](https://www.usgs.gov/media/files/landsat-wrs-2-descending-path-row-shapefile).

    -   **MODIS:** Uses the [Sinusoidal tile grid system](https://modis-land.gsfc.nasa.gov/MODLAND_grid.html). Tiles are identified according to their horizontal and vertical location in a regular grid. Here also the numbers increase from East to West and North to South**.** A shapefile of the MODIS tilling system is available [here](http://spatial-analyst.net/KML/MODIS_tiles.kmz).

    -   **Sentinel**: Uses the [Military Grid System](https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MGRS_GZD-1.png). In this system, the earth's surface is divided into 60 vertical zones (UTM zones) and 20 horizontal zones. Vertical strata are designated by numbers increasing from East to West. Horizontal segments are represented by letters from South to North. Each of these rectangles are further subdivided and identified with a 2 letter ID.

    ```{r, eco = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap = "MODIS Tiling system"}
    library(rsatExtra)
    library(t)
    data("modis_tiles")
    tmap::tmap_mode('view')
    tmap::tm_shape(modis_tiles, bbox = roi) + tmap::tm_polygons(alpha = 0, border.col = "red")
    ```

Agencies use short-names or ***ID**s* to distinguish their data products from others. Some of them are listed below. The table shows that the naming of products is not very consistent. For now, we rely on `rsat`'s manual and tables like the one below to remember the *IDs* of each data product.

```{r data_table, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='asis'}
library(pander)
data <- "
  Program    | Mission    | Satellite | Sensor | ID             
  Landsat    | Landsat-7  | Landsat-7 | ETM    | Landsat_ETM_C1
  Landsat    | Landsat-8  | Landsat-8 | OLI    | Landsat_8_C1
  MODIS      | MODIS      | Terra     | MODIS  | MOD09GA
  MODIS      | MODIS      | Aqua      | MODIS  | MYD09GA
  Copernicus | Sentinel-2 | 2A        | MSI    | S2MSI2A
  Copernicus | Sentinel-2 | 2B        | MSI    | S2MSI2A
  Copernicus | Sentinel-3 | 3A        | OLCY   | SY_SYN__
  Copernicus | Sentinel-3 | 3B        | OLCY   | SY_SYN__
"
df <- read.delim(textConnection(data),header=FALSE,sep="|",strip.white=TRUE,stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
names(df) <- unname(as.list(df[1,]))
df <- df[-1,]
row.names(df)<-NULL
pander(df, style = 'rmarkdown', caption = "Operational missions collecting multi-spectral satellite images and their relevant details")
```

## `rsat`: Quick walkthrough

In this section, we are going to run the first example using `rsat`. The aim of this exercise is to get an overview of the package's workflow. The exercise is very similar to the previous demo; we search and download satellite images for a region and time of interest. We will demonstrate that this can be done in `rsat` with a few lines of code. As with the GUI, we specify our credentials (\~long-in), then do the search, and finally download the search results.

### Credentials

Two functions in `rsat` help us handling the *usernames* and *passwords* for the various APIs; `set_credentials()` and `print_credentials()`*.* With `set_credentials()` you are indicating to `rsat` which credentials should be used and where. The function has three arguments `username`, `password`and `service`. The code below assigns to `scihub` the *username* "user" and the *password* "pass":

```{r, cache = TRUE, cache.path="cache/"}
library(rsat)
set_credentials("user","pass","scihub")
```

The function `print_credentials()` displays on the console all *usernames* and *passwords* provided so far. Note that undefined credentials remain empty (`""`):

```{r, cache = TRUE, cache.path="cache/"}
print_credentials()
```

If you followed our previous advice defining the same *usernames* and *passwords* for all the web services, we can define all of them simultaneously with a single instruction :

```{r, cache = TRUE, cache.path="cache/"}
set_credentials("user","pass")
print_credentials()
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
# set API credentials
set_credentials("rgistools", "EspacialUPNA88")
```

### Region and time of interest: `rtoi`

Next, we define our [**r**]{.ul}egion and [**t**]{.ul}ime [**o**]{.ul}f [**i**]{.ul}nterest which in `rsat` is represented by an `rtoi` class object (`S6`). We initialize our `rtoi` defining the study region. In this walkthrough, the study region (`ex.navarre`) is provided to you as a geo-referenced polygon (`sf` class object). In future lessons, you will learn how to specify your own location.

```{r warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, cache.path="cache/"}
data("ex.navarre")
```

The images of your region must be saved somewhere in your computer. Computer locations can be defined using file paths. Our `rtoi` requires two file paths; one (`db.path`) is devoted to save the original images (as they come from web service) and the other (`rtoi.path`) stores the results from customizing and processing the images.

```{r warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, cache.path="cache/"}
# path for the database
db.path <- file.path("E:/DATABASE")
# path where r
rtoi.path<-file.path("E:/regions")
# create the folder for the database
dir.create(db.path, recursive = TRUE)
```

Finally, we can create our `rtoi` using the `new_rtoi()` function as follows:

```{r warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, cache.path="cache/"}
# rtoi
navarre <- new_rtoi(name = "Navarre",
                    region = ex.navarre,
                    db_path = db.path,
                    rtoi_path = rtoi.path)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
navarre <- read_rtoi("E:/regions/Navarre")
```

### Searching images

Now we define the time of interest (`toi`). As in the demo, we are interested in satellite images from `03/05/2019` to`05/05/2019`. We can create a vector of dates typing:

```{r warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, cache.path="cache/"}
toi <- as.Date("2019-05-03") + 0:2
```

Wit all this, we are ready to perform our search, which is carried out with the function `sat_search()`. The arguments of this function are; the study region as an `rtoi`, the name or ID of the data product we are interested in (`mod09ga`), and the dates we are interested in.

```{r warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, cache.path="cache/"}
# search in the APIs
sat_search(region = navarre,
           product = c("mod09ga"),
           dates = toi)
```

`sat_search()` automatically transfers our request to the *appropriate* web service (whichever it is). Once completed, the results are saved in our `rtoi`. In future lessons we will learn how to preview these results and apply additional filters. For now, we stick to all the results which can be displayed typing:

```{r warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, cache.path="cache/"}
navarre
```

### Downloading

It is time to `download()`. The function reads the results from our previous search from our `rtoi` and acquires the images. The function downloads the images to your database location (`db.path`):

```{r warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE, cache.path="cache/"}
download(navarre)
```

### Mosaicking and plotting `rtoi`

Here we are going a little bit beyond our previous demo. The images cover a wider territory than Navarre. With the following instructions we crop our images and plot them Again, this is a little bit more advanced and we will go in detail in the following chapters.

```{r warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE, cache.path="cache/"}
mosaic(navarre)

plot(navarre,"mod09ga")
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
unlink("D:/regions/Navarre",recursive = TRUE)
```

## Exercise

Now is your turn. We want you to search (do not download) the multispectral images captured by Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and MODIS in Navarre during May 2019. Try to do it with one single `sat_search()` instruction.

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}


```
